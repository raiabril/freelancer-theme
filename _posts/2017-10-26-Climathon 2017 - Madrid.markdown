### What's Climathon?

Climathon is a 24-hour global meeting that takes place in more than 100 cities simultaneously and seeks to connect entrepreneurs, academics and professionals to explore strategies and create innovative solutions to the problems faced by cities. 2017 is the third year that is celebrated, with an exponential growth of participants.

The theme chosen for Climathon Madrid is light pollution, and the main objective is to improve the information available on this subject and raise awareness of the impact it has on society and the environment. Various workgroups are created with different approaches. The event is organized by the Department of Ontology of the Polytechnic University, for which special interest is placed on the integration of data through semantics and linked data.

It also serves as a meeting point for experts with different talks organized throughout the Climathon.

### IoT - Smart cities - Linked data


I participate in the IoT group where our objective is to study the different instruments used to measure light pollution, analyze the data obtained, propose visualizations, and propose a strategy to integrate this data on OpenStreetMap using semantics so that the data are open and available for anyone.

We conducted several experiments during the night:
1. Annotation of various elements that have impact on light pollution, especially the campus luminary, to be able to work with the vocabulary team and tag them with an entity. [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=17/40.40506/-3.83654&layers=N)

2. Measurement with different photometers located on the roof of the building to study light pollution throughout the night and see its temporal evolution. [stars4all.eu/tess](http://www.stars4all.eu/index.php/tess/)

3. Development of a tool with Google Vision API and Python to characterize elements, with their geolocation and their image, in order to be able to import more quickly to OpenStreetMap. [Repo in github](https://github.com/Climathon-Madrid-2017/vision_api)

4. With all the participants to the event, we visited an installation of the University with intelligent luminaire to collect data, so that each participant with his Smartphone becomes a sensor. This installation of the University regulates the intensity of the luminary automatically, saving more than 80% through the use of LEDs and a communication strategy between the different elements.

5. Pollution measurement using [Loss of the night](http://lossofthenight.blogspot.com.es/), an app that allows you to estimate the number of stars visible through a user survey with 8 control stars.

6. Elaboration with the team of [NixNox](http://nixnox.stars4all.eu/), researchers from the Complutense Lucia and Carlos, of a map of the campus sky. This tool allows to visualize in a very graphic way the impact that cities have on the sky. SQM photometers are used.

### Wrap up
A unique experience, sharing these 24 hours with people from different fields but with the same concern: to promote sustainable development.
