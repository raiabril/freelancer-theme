### INTRODUCTION

For decades, the inhabitants of urban centers were disconnected from the agricultural world and the natural rhythm of the earth. Whether summer or winter, north or south, in Europe it is always possible to find exotic fruit on the shelves of supermarkets, and this is thanks to a productive and logistical model with a high environmental impact. It is necessary to propose a model of sustainable and respectful consumption that follows the natural cycle of the plants.

Now, how to know what to eat and when? Looking for calendars on the web, one is faced with a large amount of contradictory information and data. The main objective of this project is to develop a reliable, complete and as accurate calendar as possible.

With this project, we want to provide a tool to support responsible consumption, limiting the excessive transport of food and the cultivation in heated greenhouses.

### METHODOLOGY

To elaborate the calendar, we have contacted organisms and people from the agricultural world to inform us about the seasons of the products in their area. We have spoken with farmers, consumer groups, agri-food observatories and ecological production councils. We have collected the data through an Excel table and an online survey.

For now, more than 15 farmers and organizations from several autonomous communities from Spain have participated in the survey: Andalusia, Asturias, Extremadura, Madrid, Murcia, Navarra and the Basque Country. There is a great work of manipulation and organization of files because the surveys were carried out through several online platforms, and to create the calendar, we made a weighted average of all the answers.

The data used to prepare the product cards have been obtained from various public and private organizations. The main ones are Mercasa, the Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness and the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, Food and Environment.

The information shown on every product card is such as:

1. Import / export flows, by product, province, means of transport, country of origin, etc. The data of the Tax Agency are available, but for this project they are analyzed through the DataComex Ministry platform.

2. Production by province in tons and in some cases by time of year.

3. Average prices according to surveys of the Ministry, with margins for farmer, market and distributor.

### NEXT STEPS

This is a collaborative, evolutive and transparent project. By filling in the survey with the calendar of the products in your area, you will help us to improve the information shown to the users according to their location.
